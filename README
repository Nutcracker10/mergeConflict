Sprint 1

A UI that
consists of
3 panels:
•
A board panel that displays the  board
.( You can download a
board image or draw your own
or paint
your own)
.
The board image should include the number of the pips
. These numbers can be fixed and can be from either players point of view.


Although they do not need to be included until Sprint 4,
allow room on the panel for a doubling cube and a match score
.
•
An information panel that allows display of text message telling the players on what is happening,
prompts them with what to do and shows previous user inputs.
•
A command panel that allows the user to enter text commands
.
The app should:
•            Display  the initial board with all of the players’ checkers on the board in the proper places
.
•          As a test, move one checker around the board from bar to bear
	- off one pip at a time. Do this for both players.

The display might be a little odd when there are checkers from both players on a single point.
That's ok because it can’t happen in the real game.

•        As a test, echo whatever the user types on the command panel to the information panel.
When the user enters “quit”, the program should terminate
.
No game functionality is needed at this stage.
